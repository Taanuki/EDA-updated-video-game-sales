Project Description: Video Game Sales Analysis and Prediction
Overview
The goal of this project is to understand video game sales trends and predict future sales. We will explore sales data across different platforms and publishers to identify patterns and insights. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, and building predictive models.

Data Description
The data used in this project includes information about video game sales from various sources, consolidated into a single dataset. The dataset includes the following columns:

Game: Name of the video game.
Copies sold: Total copies sold (in millions).
Series: Game series.
Release date: Release date of the game.
Genre: Genre of the game.
Developer: Developer of the game.
Publisher: Publisher of the game.
Console_name: Console/platform on which the game was released.
